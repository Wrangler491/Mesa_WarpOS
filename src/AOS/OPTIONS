 There are some Variables you might set:

 "Set MESA_DEBUG ON/OFF <number>"
 OFF disables output of information, ON enables it.  The number ranges from
0 (OFF) to 9.  The higher the number the more output:
  1 - names of functions at function-entry
  2 - status/modus-texts
  5 - detailed results of some functions
  8 - names of all called system-functions out of loops
  9 - names of all called system-functions in loops

 "Set MESA_PALETTEMODE COLOR/COLORSHIFT/GREY/WEIGHTED"
 WEIGHTED uses the original 189 colors for matching.
 COLORSHIFT enables 255 color palette instead of 189, and enables fast
colormatching (with shifts).
 COLOR disables shift-match, but gives better quality.  (For example, the
shift-match does not know white, but a bright blue)
 GREY enables 64 grey-levels

 "Set MESA_PENCACHE ON/OFF"
 OFF disables caching of matches, ON enables it.  This is only valid for
non-shift matches.  With this you could speed up the drawing between 1 and
nearly infinite times (it does not slow down the matching times).

 "Set MESA_PENDITHER ON/OFF"
 OFF disables dithering, ON enables it.  This is only valid for
non-shift matches.  With this you could improve the quality of drawing.
