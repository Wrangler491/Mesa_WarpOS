/*
 * Revision 3.10  1999/09/23  23:08:35  NielsF
 * - general changes:
 *   - implemented all ReadCI32*-functions
 *   - implemented fast line/triangle/quad-functions
 * - printf to Printf (added DOSBase)
 * - fixed nat/cybFastPoints/Lines-functions for RGB-mode
 * - fixed a lot of bugs caused by wrong function-call order
 * - implement some more nat/cybFastPoints/Lines-functions
 * - made the context/visual/buffer private (not readable)
 * - made 332shift a really fast thing! (much functions, but effective)
 *   create different pen-fetch functions PL8_ and PLG_
 * - allocated colormaps even for cybDisplay to allow cybReadCI* rgb2pen-conversion
 * - amigaMesaGet*/amigaMesaChange*-functions
 * - alpha-channel only availabe in (AMA_RGBMode == GL_TRUE) && (AMA_AlphaChannel == GLTRUE)
 *   changes made in Create/ChangeVisual to reflect this correctly
 * - cmnStandardInit* can handle already filled contexts (reallocate resources)
 * - randomized pen-allocation for spreading
 * - removed imageline-dependency, now it must be present
 * - dynamic allocation of Area/Raster on usage of glBegin(*) if a function
 *   was selected using AreaDraw
 * - pixel and clearpixel are now dynamic allocated black
 * - depth received _before_ access depth (otherwise before)
 * - amesa->pixel always set as APen on usage
 * - added Warp3D-support
 * - changed everything to new 3.1 API
