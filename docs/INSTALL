             Mesa compilation and installation instructions


Mesa 3.1 now uses GNU autoconfig for compilation and installation.
Previously, traditional Makefiles were used to compile Mesa.

You now have the choice of how you want to build Mesa:

  NEW-STYLE:  Basically, type "./configure" followed by "make"
              This should work on most Unix-like operating systems.
              For more details, see the NEW-STYLE section below.

  OLD-STYLE:  Simply type "make" and you'll see a list of supported
              system configurations.  Pick one and type "make <config>"
              For more details, see the OLD-STYLE section below.

NEW-STYLE Mesa compilation and installation instructions begin here
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0) If you've downloaded Mesa via CVS there will not be a "configure"
   script.  You'll have to run the "bootstrap" script first.  This script
   may not work on any OS other than Linux.

1) Run the configure script

	./configure [options]

Possible options are:

--prefix=DIR
	The toplevel directory of the hierachy in which Mesa
	will be installed (DIR/include,DIR/lib etc.).
	The default is "/usr/local".

--sysconfdir=DIR
	The directory where Mesa configuration files
	will be stored.	The default is "$prefix/etc".
	You may want to overwrite the default with --sysconfdir=/etc.

--enable-static
	Enable building of static libraries.
	Static libraries are NOT built by default.
	
--disable-shared
	Disable building of shared libraries.
	Shared libraries are built by default.

--enable-debug
	Enable debugging messages (disabled by default).
	
--enable-profile
	Enable profiling (disabled by default).
	
--disable-optimize
	Disable extra optimizations (enabled by default,
	i.e., optimize for maximum performance).
	
--enable-warn
	Enable extended compiler warnings (disabled by default).
	
--enable-x86[=ARG]
--disable-x86
	Enable/disable x86 assembler support to speed up Mesa
	(autodetected by default). You may set `on' or `off'.
	
--enable-3dnow[=ARG]
--disable-3dnow
	Enable/disable 3Dnow support to speed up Mesa
	(autodetected by default). You may set `on' or `off'.
	
--enable-mmx[=ARG]
--disable-mmx
	Enable/disable MMX support to speed up Mesa
	(autodetected by default). You may set `on' or `off'.
	
--with-glide[=DIR]
--without-glide
	Enable/disable support for Glide (autodetected by default).
	DIR is the installation directory of Glide.
	If Glide cannot be found, the driver won't be built.
	
--with-glut[=DIR]
--without-glut
	Don't/use already-installed GLUT (autodetected by default).
	DIR is the installation directory of Glut.
	If GLUT cannot be found, the version shipped with Mesa will be built.
	
--with-ggi[=DIR]
--without-ggi
	Enable/disable support for GGI (autodetected by default).
	DIR is the installation directory of GGI.
	If GGI cannot be found, the driver won't be built.

--disable-ggi-fbdev
	Don't build the GGI fbdev target (autodetected by default).
	
--disable-ggi-genkgi
	Don't build the GGI generic KGI driver (autodetected by default).
	
--disable-ggi-savage4
	Don't build the GGI Savage4 KGI driver (autodetected by default).
	
--disable-osmesa
	Disable OSmesa (offscreen rendering) support (enabled by default).

--with-svga[=DIR]
--without-svga
	Enable/disable support for SVGALib (autodetected by default).
	DIR is the installation directory of SVGALib.
	If SVGALib cannot be found, the driver won't be built.

--x-includes=DIR
	Search for the X include files in DIR.
	
--x-libraries=DIR
	Search for the X library files in DIR.

User specific compiler options can be set using the shell variable
CFLAGS. For instance,
	CFLAGS="-g -O2" ./configure
(on some systems: env CFLAGS="-g -O2" ./configure)
sets the compiler flags to "-g -O2".

For more options run "./configure --help" and read INSTALL.GNU.


2) To build the Mesa libraries run:

	make

Optionally, you can strip the libraries using

	make strip
	
Now make sure that you have the permissions to install Mesa in the 
specified directories, for example, by becoming super user ("su")
Then run:

	make install

Mesa is now installed.
Please don't move the installed files but rerun all installation
steps if you want to use other directories.


3) To test whether Mesa works properly you might want to run the Mesa demos:

	make check
	
Builds all demos.

	make exec

Builds and executes all demos.

OLD-STYLE Mesa compilation and installation instructions begin here
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build Mesa on most Unix-like operations systems, start by typing
"make" alone.  You'll see a list of supported system configurations.
Choose one, call it <config>, type "make <config>".

For system-specific information check out these files in the docs/
directory:

	System				README file

	Unix/X11			README.X11
	Windows 95/N%			README.WIN32
	DOS				README.DOS
	Linux/Windows w/ 3Dfx hardware	README.3DFX
	Linux with GGI			README.GGI
	Linux with threading		README.MITS
	Amigas with Amiwin		README.AMIWIN

	VMS				README.VMS
	Allegro DJGPP			README.DJA
	Direct3D driver			README.D3D


Header and library files:
   After you've compiled Mesa and tried the demos I recommend the following
   procedure for "installing" Mesa on Unix systems.

   Copy the Mesa include/GL directory to /usr/local/include:
	cp -r include/GL /usr/local/include

   Copy the Mesa library files to /usr/local/lib:
	cp lib/* /usr/local/lib

	(actually, use "cp -d" on Linux to preserve symbolic links)

   Create a few symbolic links so that compiling OpenGL applications is easy:
	cd /usr/local/lib
	IF USING STATIC (lib*.a) FILES THEN
		ln -s libMesaGL.a libGL.a
		ln -s libMesaGLU.a libGLU.a
	ELSE
		ln -s libMesaGL.so libGL.so
		ln -s libMesaGLU.so libGLU.so
	ENDIF
