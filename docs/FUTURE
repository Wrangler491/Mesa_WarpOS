Future plans for Mesa

  OpenGL conformance testing
	As of June 22 I've signed the paperwork but haven't got the
	test sources yet.

  Optimization of API function dispatch as proposed by Kendall Bennet
	Use a little asm code to optimize the glVertex, glNormal, glTexCoord,
	etc functions.

  Vertex array optimization
	All the vertex transformation code in vbxform.c should be moved
	into xform.c.  These functions should also be rewritten to support
	a variable stride through the source data.  This will allow
	optimizing many vertex array scenarios, including interleaved
	arrays.

	The x86 transformation code will have to be updated too.  Sorry Josh!

	This could be a nice performance boost, especially when using
	3Dfx hardware.
